Follow these steps to set up and start your Vite project.

### Prerequisites

### Installation

1. initialize project by installing packages
   
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```

3. by default we have set the port to 3000 in the `vite.config.ts` so simply visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## What I used

1) I like to use state management with start of project picked Zustand for easy of use and show I can use state management.
